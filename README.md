HOW TO:  
1). For the 'WatchListLabels' you will need to add each code block into its own script in your WATCHLISTS and set the time frame to DAILY ("D").  

2). For the "LabelsStudy" go to any ticker/chart and add the entire code as a study and Voila.  

For most labels will show Red/Green depending on +- values or above certain thresholds. Generally speaking the more of the same coloer, usually the better.  

TODOS:  

Verify rVol calculations (may compare to FinViz screener).  ****Extended hours needs to be enabled.  
Code cleanup.
